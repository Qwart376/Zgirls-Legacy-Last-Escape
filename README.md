[How to contribute]
I'm unable to fully decompile game files and need to rip all needed textures from screenshots. Bellow is the list of materials I require help with
As for the game reconstruction, I need to code everything from stratch in Unity and the game won't be online. As soon I have a working Alpha and the game is shut down (to minimalize chances of a copystrike and legal trouble) it will be posted
The progress will be updated on discord server (if invite inspires, open request in issues tab):
